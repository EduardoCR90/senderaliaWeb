      <p>
        We are a profesional and experienced team dedicated to show and guide people over all the amazing hikes located in our islands. 
        Hiking in Tenerife convinced us that the Canary Islands are one of the best-hiking destinations in Spain. 
        From sweeping volcanic landscapes which remembers us Mars, to go across great green mountains until go swimming into the sea! 
        The most impressive hiking trails in Tenerife are concentrated in the Anaga mountains, Teide National Park, and the Teno mountains.
