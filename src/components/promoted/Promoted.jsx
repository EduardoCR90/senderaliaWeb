          The holiday season is the perfect time to get together with friends and family. With that in mind, weâ€™d like to invite you to our Annual Christmas Party and Gift Exchange.
          It will take place on saturday 25 December in one of our favourites places in Tenerife: Benijo Beach, Anaga.

          This adventure is planned just for our hardcore clients who want to live an incredible experience with us!
          This trail has many inclines, steep hills, a long steady climb, slippery rocks and other difficult terrains which we love to share with you.
          Join us the next month!
